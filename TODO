- Try training one-vs-all classification models for all notes separately
  (perhaps use synthetic training data with 50/50 split and relatively high amount of hard-to-distinct examples)
  (perhaps use Focal loss as well)
- Learn about some of the following technologies: Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, Snowflake

3. Adjust the training code accordingly
(make dataset location dependent on the environment the code is run in etc.):

4. Try using gradient-checkpointing to save memory:
